# Smart study planner 
Web application / Mobile app 
## What is the project going to be about?
This application is going to be a tool for students that wanna optimize their time schedule (lectures, labs, homework etc..) in the most efficient way possible using alghoritms or as people like to call it "AI". The alghoritm will take into consideration also personal traits, selected upon creating an account (for example if you wanna do sports).

## Key functions
#### Basic planning
This will include calendar, to-do-list and automatic planning which was mentioned.

#### Adaptive planning 
If for example a student doesnt get something done, app will automatically reschedule optimally.

#### Detection of overload
If student has too much stuff doing in a short time window the app will notify the user with a recommendation of rescheduling.

#### "Gamification" 
User will be able to earn badges and rewards throughout the system to get more motivated. There will also be a page of users statistics (lets call it progress). 
There will also be a friend system, where you can share your previous achievements and schedules.
